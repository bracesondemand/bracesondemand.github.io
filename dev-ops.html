    <h1>CI/CD Deployment Documentation</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This documentation outlines the process of using CircleCI for deploying a private frontend and uploading builds
        to S3. The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages: building, testing, deploying, and releasing. The
        frontend is hosted on S3, and updates are pushed via CircleCI.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>Before starting, make sure you have the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A CircleCI account with access to the GitHub repository for the frontend.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deployment Process</h2>

    <p>The CI/CD pipeline follows these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>When changes are pushed to the repository, CircleCI runs the test defined in the `config.yml` file.</li>
        <li>CircleCI waits for manual approval</li>
        <li>Once a CircleCI job is manualy approved. It starts building and deployment.</li>
        <li>The deployment process uploads the build to the S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.</li>
        <li>The release process invalidate the CloundFront of the private frontend.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>The following security measures are implemented:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AWS credentials are encrypted and stored in CircleCI's environment variables.</li>
        <li>HTTPS is used to encrypt traffic between the frontend and the user's browser.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>SSL Certificates - Backend Server</h2>

    <p>To auto-update SSL on a Windows server, We are using a Let's Encrypt client <a
            href="https://www.win-acme.com/">WinAcme</a> on our server. We are using Windows Task Scheduler that runs
        the Let's Encrypt client's renewal command.</p>

    <h2>SSL Certificates - Frontend Server</h2>
        We are using  <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">AWS ACM (CERTIFICATE MANAGER)</a> to handle SSL certificates on our frontend domains.
    <h2>Reverse Proxy - Backend Server</h2>
    <p>We are using Windows IIS Manager to implement reverse proxy functionality in windows server.</p>

    <h2>AWS Identity Center (Single Sign-on)</h2>
    <p>We are using AWS Identity Center. It's is a cloud-based service that makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. With AWS SSO, you can set up single sign-on for your entire organization, allowing your users to access all the applications they need with a single set of credentials.
